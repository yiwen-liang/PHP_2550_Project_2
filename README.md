## PHP2550 Project 2: Regression Analysis

${\color{gray}Posted: 11/05/2023}$

This is the 2nd project assignment of PHP2550 Practical Data Analysis course at Brown University (Fall 23).

In this project, our goal is to develop a regression model for prediction based on the data from Dr. Schmidâ€™s research. This project focuses on describing and interpreting the chosen models and then providing predictions on the composite outcome of tracheostomy and death to help clinicians determine who really needs a tracheostomy and the ideal timing of tracheostomy placement.	The submitted report and the code used for this analysis will be available here. The dataset is not available to the public.
